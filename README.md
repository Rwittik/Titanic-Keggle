# Predicting the survival status of passengers on the Titanic Using Logistic Regression.

In this problem I used real data from the Titanic to calculate conditional probabilities and expectations.and also I used information from titanic.csv datset. The dataset for this problem is taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data

I created a model with the following steps:

1.Download and explore the dataset<br/>
2.Prepare the dataset for training<br/>
3.Create a logstic regression model<br/>
4.Train the model to fit the data<br/>
5.Make predictions using the trained model<br/>

Variable Notes:

Survival: Whether a passenger survived or not; 1 if survived and 0 if not.<br/>
sibsp: Number of siblings / spouses aboard the Titanic<br/>
parch: Number of parents / children aboard the Titanic<br/>
embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)<br/>
